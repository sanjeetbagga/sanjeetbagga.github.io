# Chill guys
More and more people are getting affected by modern-day stress. They feel the need to be perfect and become the quintessence of the overachiever student or jock or what not. But seriously, you guys aren't even in your twenty's yet. Chill. I understand the frustration of trying to get into college. I have been prepping for my SAT's and ACT's as much as the next High School student. I have been writing essays and trying to balance that with my life as much as the next High School student. I know the frustration. But, do not make that unbearable for you. Striving for the perfect GPA, the perfect SAT or any test score. the best person to DISPLAY to colleges is honestly the wrong approach. Be YOURSELF. Live your life. Stressing out over these things are not worth it. Try your best, yes, but do not let it wipe away who you are on the inside.
