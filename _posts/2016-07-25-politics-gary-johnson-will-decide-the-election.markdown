# Gary Johnson will decide this election

Whether you like it or not, the Libertarian Candidate for president, Gary Johnson, will be deciding who will win this presidential election. Here is why: 

- He is polling very highly, around 15 percent, which is enough to get him into the debates (look at any recent poll)
- Liberals and Conservatives are leaving their parties with drastic numbers
- More and more people are recognizing themselves as independents (more than those who affiliate themselves as any party)
- He has reached 15 percent with bare media coverage. Imagine with media coverage.

I would keep an eye out for these third party candidates during this election, as unfavorable ratings are high with both major parties.
